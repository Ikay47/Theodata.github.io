            <h1>Shark Attack report</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This report presents the findings of an extensive data analysis conducted on shark attacks from 1900 to 2022.
        The dataset, consisting of approximately 5000 entries, was obtained from the quantum analytics google drive.</p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The primary objective of this analysis was to perform an exploratory data analysis to identify trends and gain
        insights into shark attacks. Additionally, the aim was to provide recommendations to mitigate and minimize the
        occurrence of attacks and fatalities.</p>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>The dataset was imported into Power BI and underwent thorough data transformation using the power query editor.
        The dataset required significant cleaning, particularly in the species column, which involved employing
        functions such as trim, clean, and replace values.<br>
    Firstly, columns with null values were filtered out, and incorrect species names were replaced with the
        appropriate ones. Subsequently, any incident records dated before 1900 or after 2022 were removed from the
        dataset.</p>

    <h2>Key Insights</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Metrics</strong>
        The analysis revealed the involvement of 47 different shark species, with the white shark being the most
            commonly reported attacker.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Sex Distribution</strong>
        Approximately 89% of the victims were males, which aligns with the well-known tendency of men to engage in
            more adventurous activities. The median age of the victims was determined to be 24 years.
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Fatalities</strong>
        The report indicates a fatality rate of approximately 6%. However, due to the lack of available information,
            the severity and consequences of the injuries could not be accurately ascertained.</li>

    <li><strong>Incident Types</strong>
        Around 4000 attacks were classified as unprovoked, while 536 were categorized as provoked. Notably, there were
            almost 2000 attacks where the incident type was undocumented or unknown.</li>

    <li><strong>Time Analysis</strong>
        The majority of incidents occurred during the middle of the year, with additional spikes in January and
            December. These periods often coincide with holidays or vacation periods. It is worth noting that the highest
            reported incidence was recorded in 1905, followed by a significant decline. This drop may be attributed to
            underreporting. However, incident rates gradually increased from 1929 to 2016 before experiencing another
            decline. This gradual rise can be attributed to population growth.</li>

    <li><strong>Location</strong>
        The United States had the highest number of recorded attacks, followed by Australia, which accounted for
            approximately 50% of their respective records.
    </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
             Increase the dissemination of education and information on safety measures and emergency management, with
                a particular focus on young males between the ages of 18 and 30.
        </li>
        <li>
            Conduct comprehensive surveys of vacation sites to identify potential dangers or the presence of shark
                populations. Implement proactive measures to prevent disasters, including the presence of shark and
                safety experts at tourist destinations.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ensure clear and meticulous documentation of incident data collection to avoid ambiguity during future
                analyses.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>In conclusion, this data analysis provides valuable insights into shark attacks from 1900 to 2022. The findings
        and recommendations can inform efforts to minimize the occurrence of shark attacks and enhance public safety.
        Continuous data collection and analysis will be crucial in maintaining an up-to-date understanding of this
        complex phenomenon.</p>
