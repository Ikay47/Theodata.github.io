            <h1>Olist E-commerce analysis</h1>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Analysis on a Brazilian online store (Olist) using data from 2016 to 2018.</p>
            
            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>The main goal was to conduct an exploratory data analysis on Olist data to find trends using appropriate charts to devise strategies to improve sales.</p>
            
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>Data was obtained from Quantum Analytics Google Drive. Nine tables representing customers, geolocation, order items, payments, reviews, orders, products, sellers, and product category names were imported into the Power BI app. The data was then transformed using the Power Query Editor. The tables were joined using different primary keys to establish multiple linkages.</p>

            <h2>Key Insights</h2>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>KPI: </strong>
            Overall, the number of orders shows a steep upward trend. The total revenue generated was 16 million dollars with 96 thousand unique customers contributing to 99,000 orders. There was an average rating of 4.09 on all the products.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Revenue: </strong>
                The health and beauty products generated the most revenues followed by watches and gifts. This shows females engage more on the store although more data is needed to prove that.</li>


            <li><strong>Payment types: </strong>
                74% of purchases were made via credit cards. Boleto was at 19% and the remaining was between voucher and debit card.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Monthly Trends: </strong>
                Generally, most of the orders were made from January to August before dropping significantly from September through December. There was a spike in November likely due to “11/11 sales”. Some notable deviation from this trend was seen with air conditioners and toys. Air conditioner sales spiking in March, April, and August while toys had increased sales in May because of Children's Day, November, and December coinciding with the Christmas holidays.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Order Location: </strong>
                Sao Paulo had the most orders at 15,540 followed by Rio de Janeiro which was below half of Sao Paulo’s orders at 6,882. Other cities were below 3,000 orders.</li>
            
            
        </ul>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Collect more data on the gender and age of customers for further analysis to link and predict purchase patterns.</li>
              <li>Ensure the credit card payment system is not disrupted since it is the most preferred method of payment.</li>
              <li>Incorporate more discounted sale periods from September to December.</li>
              <li>Increase advertisements in other cities to create more awareness for the store.</li>
              <li>Analyze customer feedback and reviews to identify areas for improvement and enhance customer satisfaction.</li>
              <li>Implement targeted marketing campaigns based on customer segments, considering factors such as geographic location and product preferences.</li>
              <li>Evaluate and optimize the product assortment to align with customer demand and capitalize on high-revenue categories.</li>
              <li>Enhance customer loyalty and retention through personalized promotions, rewards programs, and exceptional customer service.</li>
