            <h1>US Flights Analysis</h1>

            <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
            <p>
              This project aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of local flight activities in the United States in 2015. The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from Quantum Analytics and imported into a centralized analytics dashboard solution.
            </p>
          
            <h2>GOAL</h2>
            <p>
              The primary objectives of this analysis are to gain insights into flight cancellations, identify areas for improvement, and provide guidance for flight planning and investments within the aviation industry.
            </p>
          
            <h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>
            <p>
              The dataset was sourced from a Google Drive account and underwent cleaning and preprocessing using R in RStudio due to its large size. Cleaned data was then exported to Tableau, where interactive dashboards incorporating appropriate graphs, charts, and cards were created.

            <h2>KEY INSIGHTS</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Flights:</strong> Total flights analyzed was about 2 million of which 62% of them were on schedule while 36% and 1.5% were for delayed flights and cancelled flights respectively. There was an average delay time of 35 minutes.</li>
              <li><strong>Cancellation Reasons:</strong> Of the about 30,000 cancelled flights, 56% of them were due to adverse weather conditions, 30% by airline issues, and 14% caused by the national air system.</li>
              <li><strong>Monthly Trends:</strong> On average, there were about 175,000 flights per month ranging from 189,000 in July to 149,275 in February. In June, 42% of the flights were either delayed or canceled, while September had 72% of flights operating on schedule.</li>
              <li><strong>Daily Trends:</strong> Overall, there were about 280,000 flights occurring each day from Sunday to Friday, with Saturdays having the least at 232,000.</li>
              <li><strong>Top Performers:</strong> In terms of traffic, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and Chicago O'Hare International Airport topped the list with 693,000 and 570,000 flights recorded respectively.</li>
            </ul>
          
            <h2>RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>More collaborations should be done with weather scientists</strong> before scheduling flights to avoid delays or cancellations.</li>
              <li><strong>Further investigations should be done</strong> to determine the contributing factors to airline issues and implement corrective measures.</li>
              <li><strong>In February and on Saturdays, consider lowering the price of the ticket</strong> to attract more passengers.</li>
              <li><strong>When considering business in the aviation industry, prioritize top airports or cities</strong> with high traffic volume, such as Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and Chicago O'Hare International Airport.</li>
            </ol>
