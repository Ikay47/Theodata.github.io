            <h1>About this Project</h1>
  
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Analysis on Mexican restaurants</p>
            
            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>The main goal was to conduct an exploratory data analysis on restaurants in four Mexican cities: San Luis Potosi, Ciudad Victoria, Cuernavaca, Jiutepec.</p>
            
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>Data was obtained from Quantum Analytics Google Drive. Five tables in CSV format were imported into Tableau. The consumer preference and ratings were joined to consumers via consumer ID, while restaurant cuisines and restaurants were joined to ratings via restaurant ID. Dashboards were created using appropriate charts and graphs to visualize the findings.</p>

            <h2>Recommendations</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>More data needs to be collected on the population of other cities for analysis on the need for more restaurants in those areas.</li>
              <li>Offer more cuisines to meet consumer preferences, as data suggests that choices were limited to Mexican cuisine.</li>
              <li>Consider smoking permissions, given that nearly 95% of consumers are non-smokers.</li>
              <li>Make more dishes affordable in the medium and low budget range, considering a high proportion of consumers fall within these categories, especially students.</li>
              <li>Collect additional data on the cost of meals to conduct revenue and profit analysis, enabling improved business outcomes.</li>
            </ol>
          
         <p> This analysis report provides valuable insights into the Mexican restaurant industry and offers actionable recommendations to enhance operational strategies and customer satisfaction.</p>
