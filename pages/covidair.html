		<h1>Covid impact on airport traffic</h1>

		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>The objective of this project is to leverage data analytics to analyze the impact of Covid-19 on airport activities. A dataset shared on Google Docs by Quantum Analytics was used as the primary data source. The goal is to study the extent to which airport traffic was affected in 2020 in select cities in the US.</p>

		<h2>Methodology</h2>
		<p><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> The data was cleaned using Power BI Power Query Editor, which involved removing null values, creating new columns, and employing DAX functions to generate primary and secondary metrics for comprehensive analysis.</p>
		<p> <strong>Data Visualization:</strong>  Appropriate charts and graphs were utilized to effectively represent the data points. An interactive dashboard was developed to facilitate the exploration of the top 10 most and least affected cities and airports. Additionally, a monthly trend analysis was conducted comparing the average number of flight cancellations to the baseline.</p>
	
		<h2>Key Insights</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Average Performance:</strong> The average airport performance in the studied cities was at 67% of the pre-Covid baseline.</li>
            <li><strong>Least Affected Cities:</strong> Hamilton, Winnipeg, and Calgary experienced the least impact, with approximately 90% of their flights unaffected.</li>
            <li><strong>Most Affected Cities:</strong> Santiago, Sydney, and Paradise were the cities most severely impacted, with only about 35% of the pre-Covid traffic.</li>
            <li><strong>Least Affected Airports:</strong> Hamilton International Airport exhibited the least impact, followed by Winnipeg International Airport, aligning with the trend observed in the least affected cities.</li>
            <li><strong>Most Affected Airports:</strong> Santiago International Airport, Kingsford Smith Airport, and McCarran International Airport were the most heavily affected airports.</li>
            <li><strong>Monthly Trends:</strong> The volume of air traffic reached its lowest point in April but gradually increased on a monthly basis, eventually reaching pre-Covid levels in December.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Future Pandemic Preparedness:</strong> In the event of a future pandemic, it is advisable to consider investing in airports located in Hamilton, Winnipeg, and Calgary, as these cities demonstrated greater stability and resilience during the crisis.</li>
            <li><strong>Addressing Most Affected Airports:</strong> To mitigate the challenges faced by the most affected airports, it is recommended to allocate additional investments and implement measures aimed at reducing flight cancellations and enhancing safety protocols.</li>
        </ol>
