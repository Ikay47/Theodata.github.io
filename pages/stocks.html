            <h1>HISTORICAL STOCK PRICE ANALYSIS</h1>

            <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
            <p>This project involved conducting a comprehensive analysis of the historical stock prices of several popular companies. The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from the Quantum Analytics Google Drive.</p>
          
            <h2>GOAL</h2>
            <p>The primary objective of this analysis was to perform a descriptive comparison of the stock price growth among different companies.</p>
          
            <h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>
            <p>To accomplish this goal, the tables were imported into the Power BI application and subsequently transformed using the Power Query Editor. Ten tables were imported, each representing a specific company, namely Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Tesla, Uber, Walmart, and Zoom.</p>
            <p>Each table consisted of columns displaying the opening, closing, high, and low prices, arranged chronologically. Additional columns were created to calculate the spread and profit margin, which entailed determining the difference between the opening and closing prices, as well as the high and low prices, respectively.</p>
            <p>Null values were thoroughly examined, but none were found. Finally, appropriate charts and KPI cards were utilized to visualize the data effectively.</p>

            <h2>KEY INSIGHTS</h2>
          
            <ul>
              <li><strong>KPI</strong> - On average, the open, close, high, and low prices for all companies hovered around $419. However, it is worth noting that both Amazon and Google exhibited values surpassing $1000 individually.</li>
              <li><strong>Spread</strong> - The average daily spread across all companies combined was approximately $10. However, the top-performing companies, namely Amazon and Google, recorded spreads of $36 and $22, respectively.</li>
              <li><strong>Profit</strong> - Overall, the net daily profit amounted to 0.07. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that Amazon, Uber, and Zoom experienced net losses instead.</li>
              <li><strong>Monthly Trends</strong> - Generally, the monthly trade volume amounted to approximately $40 billion, with March recording the highest volume at $48 billion.</li>

            </ul>
          
            <h2>Recommendations</h2>
          
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Diversify Investments</strong>: Considering the consistently strong performance of Amazon and Google in terms of price spread, investors may benefit from including these companies in their investment portfolios.</li>
              <li><strong>Monitor Loss-making Companies</strong>: Given that Amazon, Uber, and Zoom experienced net losses, it is crucial for investors to closely monitor these companies to assess their future profitability potential.</li>
              <li><strong>Analyze Monthly Trends</strong>: Understanding the monthly trade volume fluctuations can provide valuable insights for strategic decision-making. Identifying the reasons behind the highest trade volume in March can help anticipate future market trends.</li>
              <li><strong>Evaluate Competitors</strong>: Despite Amazon and Google's impressive price spreads, Apple demonstrated superior performance in terms of total trade volume. Investors should analyze the competitive landscape to assess the factors contributing to Apple's success and evaluate thepotential for other companies to replicate such performance.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>By following these recommendations, investors can make more informed decisions when navigating the stock market and capitalize on the opportunities presented by different companies.<p/>
